## 1 Complex Selectors

Selectors are one of, if not, the most important parts of CSS. They
shape the cascade and determine how styles are to be applied to elements
on a page.

Up until recently the focus of CSS never really touched on selectors.
Occasionally there would be incremental updates within the selectors
specification, but never any real ground breaking improvements.
Fortunately, more attention has been given to selectors as of late,
taking a look at how to select different types of elements and elements
in different states of use.

CSS3 brought new selectors, opening a whole new world of opportunities
and improvements to existing practices. Here we'll discuss
[selectors](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/),
old and new, and how to best put them to use.

## 2 Common Selectors

Before diving too deep into some of the more complex selectors, and
those offered within CSS3, let's take a quick look at some of the more
common selectors seen today. These selectors include the type, class,
and ID selectors.

The **type** selector identifies an element based on its type,
specifically how that element is declared within HTML. The **class**
selector identifies an element based on its class attribute value, which
may be reused on multiple elements as necessary to help share popular
styles. Lastly, the **ID** selector identifies an element based on its ID
attribute value, which is unique and should only be used once per page.

```
h1 {...}
.tagline {...}
#intro {...}

```

```
<section id="intro">
  <h1>...</h1>
  <h2 class="tagline">...</h2>
</section>

```

### 2.1 Common Selectors Overview

| Example | Classification | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `h1` | Type Selector | Selects an element by it's type |
| `.tagline` | Class Selector | Selects an element by the class attribute value, which may be reused multiple times per page |
| `#intro` | ID Selector | Selects an element by the ID attribute value, which is unique and to only be used once per page |

## 3 Child Selectors

Child selectors provide a way to select elements that fall within one
another, thus making them children of their parent element. These
selections can be made two different ways, using either descendant or
direct child selectors.

### 3.1 Descendant Selector

The most common child selector is the descendant selector, which matches
every element that follows an identified ancestor. The descendant
element does not have to come directly after the ancestor element inside
the document tree, such as a parent-child relationship, but may fall
anywhere within the ancestor element. Descendant selectors are created
by spacing apart elements within a selector, creating a new level of
hierarchy for each element list.

The `article h2` selector is a descendant selector, only selecting `h2`
elements that fall inside of an `article` element. Notice, no matter
where a `h2` element lives, so long as it is within the `article`
element, it will always be selected. Additionally, any `h2` element
outside of the `article` element is not selected.

Below, the headings are lines 3 and 5 are selected.

```
article h2 {...}

```

```
<h2>...</h2>
<article>
  <h2>This heading will be selected</h2>
  <div>
    <h2>This heading will be selected</h2>
  </div>
</article>

```

### 3.2 Direct Child Selector

Sometimes descendant selectors go a bit overboard, selecting more than
hoped. At times only the direct children of a parent element need to be
selected, not every instance of the element nested deeply inside of an
ancestor. In this event the direct child selector may be used by placing
a greater than sign, `>`, between the parent element and child element
within the selector.

For example, `article > p` is a direct child selector only identifying
`p` elements that fall directly within an `article` element. Any `p`
element placed outside of an `article` element, or nested inside of
another element other than the `article` element, will not be selected.

Below, the paragraph on line 3 is the only direct child of it's parent
article, thus selected.

```
article > p {...}

```

```
<p>...</p>
<article>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
  <div>
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
</article>

```

#### 3.2.1 Child Selectors Overview

| Example | Classification | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `article h2` | Descendant Selector | Selects an element that resides anywhere within an identified ancestor element |
| `article > p` | Direct Child Selector | Selects an element that resides immediately inside an identified parent element |

## 4 Sibling Selectors

Knowing how to [select children](http://css-tricks.com/child-and-sibling-selectors/)
of an element is largely beneficial, and quite commonly seen. However
sibling elements, those elements that share a common parent, may also
need to be selected. These sibling selections can be made by way of the
general sibling and adjacent sibling selectors.

### 4.1 General Sibling Selector

The general sibling selector allow elements to be selected based on
their sibling elements, those which share the same common parent. They
are created by using the tilde character, `~`, between two elements
within a selector. The first element identifies what the second element
shall be a sibling with, and both of which must share the same parent.

The `h2 ~ p` selector is a general sibling selector that looks for `p`
elements that follow, and share the same parent, of any `h2` elements.
In order for a `p` element to be selected it must come after any `h2`
element.

The paragraphs on lines 5 and 9 are selected as they come after the
heading within the document tree and share the same parent as their
sibling heading.

```

h2 ~ p {...}

```

```

<p>...</p>
<section>
  <p>...</p>
  <h2>...</h2>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
  <div>
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
</section>

```

### 4.2 Adjacent Sibling Selector

Occasionally a little more control may be desired, including the ability
to select a sibling element that directly follows after another sibling
element, which is where the adjacent sibling element comes in. The
adjacent sibling selector will only select sibling elements directly
following after another sibling element. Instead of using the tilde
character, as with general sibling selectors, the adjacent sibling
selector uses a plus character, `+`, between the two elements within a
selector. Again, the first element identifies what the second element
shall directly follow after and be a sibling with, and both of which
must share the same parent.

Looking at the adjacent sibling selector `h2 + p` only `p` elements
directly following after `h2` elements will be selected. Both of which
must also share the same parent element.

The paragraph on line 5 is selected as it directly follows after its
sibling heading along with sharing the same parent element, thus
selected.

```
h2 + p {...}

```

```
<p>...</p>
<section>
  <p>...</p>
  <h2>...</h2>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
  <div>
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
  <p>...</p>
</section>

```

### 4.3 Sibling Selectors Example

  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
  color: #ff7b29;
}

```

#### 4.3.1 Sibling Selectors Overview

| Example | Classification | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `h2 ~ p` | General Sibling Selector | Selects an element that follows anywhere after the prior element, in which both elements share the same parent |
| `h2 + p` | Adjacent Sibling Selector | Selects an element that follows directly after the prior element, in which both elements share the same parent |

## 5 Attribute Selectors

Some of the common selectors looked at early may also be defined as
attribute selectors, in which an element is selected based up on its
class or ID value. These class and ID attribute selectors are widely
used and extremely powerful but only the beginning. Other
[attribute
selectors](http://www.css3.info/preview/attribute-selectors/) have emerged over the years, specifically taking a large
leap forward with CSS3. Now elements can be selected based on whether an
attribute is present and what its value may contain.

### 5.1 Attribute Present Selector

The first attribute selector identifies an element based on whether it
includes an attribute or not, regardless of any actual value. To select
an element based on if an attribute is present or not simply include the
attribute name in square brackets, `[]`, within a selector. The square
brackets may or may not follow any qualifier such as an element type or
class, all depending on the level of specificity desired.

```
a[target] {...}

```

```

<a href="#" target="_blank">...</a>

```

### 5.2 Attribute Equals Selector

To identify an element with a specific, and exact matching, attribute
value the same selector from before may be used, however this time
inside of the square brackets following the attribute name, include the
desired matching value. Inside the square brackets should be the
attribute name followed by an equals sign, `=`, quotations, `""`, and
inside of the quotations should be the desired matching attribute value.

```
a[href="http://google.com/"] {...}

```

```
<a href="http://google.com/">...</a>

```

### 5.3 Attribute Contains Selector

When looking to find an element based on part of an attribute value, but
not an exact match, the asterisk character, `*`, may be used within the
square brackets of a selector. The asterisk should fall just after the
attribute name, directly before the equals sign. Doing so denotes that
the value to follow only needs to appear, or be contained, within the
attribute value.

```
a[href*="login"] {...}

```

```
<a href="/login.php">...</a>

```

### 5.4 Attribute Begins With Selector

In addition to selecting an element based on if an attribute value
contains a stated value, it is also possible to select an element based
on what an attribute value begins with. Using a circumflex accent, `^`,
within the square brackets of a selector between the attribute name and
equals sign denotes that the attribute value should begin with the
stated value.

```
a[href^="https://"] {...}

```

```
<a href="https://chase.com/">...</a>

```

### 5.5 Attribute Ends With Selector

Opposite of the begins with selector, there is also an ends with
attribute selector. Instead of using the circumflex accent, the ends
with attribute selector uses the dollar sign, `$`, within the square
brackets of a selector between the attribute name and equals sign. Using
the dollar sign denotes that the attribute value needs to end with the
stated value.

```
a[href$=".pdf"] {...}

```

```
<a href="/docs/menu.pdf">...</a>

```

### 5.6 Attribute Spaced Selector

At times attribute values may be spaced apart, in which only one of the
words needs to be matched in order to make a selection. In this event
using the tilde character, `~`, within the square brackets of a selector
between the attribute name and equals sign denotes an attribute value
that should be whitespace-separated, with one word matching the exact
stated value.

```
a[rel~="tag"] {...}

```

```
<a href="#" rel="tag nofollow">...</a>

```

### 5.7 Attribute Hyphenated Selector

When an attribute value is hyphen-separated, rather than
whitespace-separated, the vertical line character, `|`, may be used
within the square brackets of a selector between the attribute name and
equals sign. The vertical line denotes that the attribute value may be
hyphen-separated however the hyphen-separated words must begin with the
stated value.

```
a[lang|="en"] {...}

```

```
<a href="#" lang="en-US">...</a>

```

### 5.8 Attribute Selectors Example

```
<ul>
  <li><a href="#.pdf">PDF Document</a></li>
  <li><a href="#.doc">Word Document</a></li>
  <li><a href="#.jpg">Image File</a></li>
  <li><a href="#.mp3">Audio File</a></li>
  <li><a href="#.mp4">Video File</a></li>
</ul>

```

```
ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
a {
  background-position: 0 50%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  color: #0087cc;
  padding-left: 22px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
  color: #ff7b29;
}
a[href$=".pdf"] {
  background-image: url("images/pdf.png");
}
a[href$=".doc"] {
  background-image: url("images/doc.png");
}
a[href$=".jpg"] {
  background-image: url("images/image.png");
}
a[href$=".mp3"] {
  background-image: url("images/audio.png");
}
a[href$=".mp4"] {
  background-image: url("images/video.png");
}

```

#### 5.8.1 Attribute Selectors Overview

| Example | Classification | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a[target]` | Attribute Present Selector | Selects an element if the given attribute is present |
| `a[href="http://google.com/"]` | Attribute Equals Selector | Selects an element if the given attribute value exactly matches the value stated |
| `a[href*="login"]` | Attribute Contains Selector | Selects an element if the given attribute value contains at least once instance of the value stated |
| `a[href^="https://"]` | Attribute Begins With Selector | Selects an element if the given attribute value begins with the value stated |
| `a[href$=".pdf"]` | Attribute Ends With Selector | Selects an element if the given attribute value ends with the value stated |
| `a[rel~="tag"]` | Attribute Spaced Selector | Selects an element if the given attribute value is whitespace-separated with one word being exactly as stated |
| `a[lang`| `="en"]` | Attribute Hyphenated Selector | Selects an element if the given attribute value is hyphen-separated and begins with the word stated |

## 6 Pseudo-classes

Pseudo-classes are similar to regular classes in HTML however they are not directly
stated within the markup, instead they are a dynamically populated as a
result of users actions or the document structure. The most common
pseudo-class, and one you've likely seen before, is `:hover`. Notice how
this pseudo-class begins with the colon character, `:`, as will all
other pseudo-classes.

### 6.1 Link Pseudo-classes

Some of the more basic pseudo-classes include two revolving around links
specifically. The `:link` and `:visited` pseudo-classes define if a link
has or hasn't been visited. To style an anchor which has not been
visited the `:link` pseudo-class comes into play, where the `:visited`
pseudo-class styles links that a user has already visited based on their
browsing history.

```
a:link {...}
a:visited {...}

```

### 6.2 User Action Pseudo-classes

Based on a users actions different pseudo-classes may be dynamically
applied to an element, of which include the `:hover`, `:active`, and
`:focus` pseudo-classes. The `:hover` pseudo-class is applied to an
element when a user moves their cursor over the element, most commonly
used with anchor elements. The `:active` pseudo-class is applied to an
element when a user engages an element, such as clicking on an element.
Lastly, the `:focus` pseudo-class is applied to an element when a user
has made an element the focus point of the page, often by using the
keyboard to tab from one element to another.

```
a:hover {...}
a:active {...}
a:focus {...}

```

### 6.3 User Interface State Pseudo-classes

As with the link pseudo-classes there are also some pseudo-classes
generated around the user interface state of elements, particularly
within form elements. These user interface element state pseudo-classes
include `:enabled`, `:disabled`, `:checked`, and `:indeterminate`.

The `:enabled` pseudo-class selects an input that is in the default
state of enabled and available for use, where the `:disabled`
pseudo-class selects an input that has the `disabled` attribute tied to
it. Many browsers by default will fade out disabled inputs to inform
users that the input is not available for interaction, however those
styles may be adjusted as wished with the `:disabled` pseudo-class.

```
input:enabled {...}
input:disabled {...}

```

The last two user interface element state pseudo-classes of `:checked`
and `:indeterminate` revolve around checkbox and radio button input
elements. The `:checked` pseudo-class selects checkboxes or radio
buttons that are, as you may expect, checked. When a checkbox or radio
button has neither been selected or unselected it lives in an
indeterminate state, from which the `:indeterminate` pseudo-class can be
used to target these elements.

```
input:checked {...}
input:indeterminate {...}

```

### 6.4 Structural & Position Pseudo-classes

A handful of pseudo-classes are structural and position based, in which
they are determined based off where elements reside in the document
tree. These structural and position based pseudo-classes come in a few
different shapes and sizes, each of which provides their own unique
function. Some pseudo-classes have been around longer than others,
however CSS3 brought way of an entire new set of pseudo-classes to
supplement the existing ones.

#### 6.4.1 :first-child, :last-child, & :only-child

The first structural and position based pseudo-classes one is likely to
come across are the `:first-child`, `:last-child`, and `:only-child`
pseudo-classes. The `:first-child` pseudo-class will select an element
if it's the first child within its parent, while the `:last-child`
pseudo-class will select an element if it's the last element within its
parent. These pseudo-classes are prefect for selecting the first or last
items in a list and so forth. Additionally, the `:only-child` will
select an element if it is the only element within a parent.
Alternately, the `:only-child` pseudo-class could be written as
`:first-child:last-child`, however `:only-child` holds a lower
specificity.

Here the selector `li:first-child` identifies the first list item within
a list, while the selector `li:last-child` identifies the last list item
within a list, thus lines 2 and 10 are selected. The selector
`div:only-child` is looking for a division which is the single child of
a parent element, without any other other siblings. In this case line 4
is selected as it is the only division within the specific list item.

```

li:first-child {...}
li:last-child {...}
div:only-child {...}

```

```

<ul>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>
    <div>This div will be selected</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>...</div>
    <div>...</div>
  </li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
</ul>

```

#### 6.4.2 :first-of-type, :last-of-type, & :only-of-type

Finding the first, last, and only children of a parent is pretty
helpful, and often all that is needed. However sometimes you only want
to select the first, last, or only child of a specific type of element.
For example, should you only want to select the first or last paragraph
within an article, or perhaps the only image within an article.
Fortunately this is where the `:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type`, and
`:only-of-type` pseudo-selectors come into place.

The `:first-of-type` pseudo-class will select the first element of its
type within a parent, while the `:last-of-type` pseudo-class will select
the last element of its type within a parent. The `:only-of-type`
pseudo-class will select an element if it is the only of its type within
a parent.

In the example below the `p:first-of-type` and `p:last-of-type`
pseudo-classes select the first and last paragraphs within the article
respectively, regardless if they are actually the first or last children
within the article. Lines 3 and 6 are selected reflex these selectors.
The `img:only-of-type` selector identifies the image on line 5 as it is
the only image to appear within the article, thus also selected.

```

p:first-of-type {...}
p:last-of-type {...}
img:only-of-type {...}

```

```

<article>
  <h1>...</h1>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <img src="#"><!-- This image will be selected -->
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
  <h6>...</h6>
</article>

```

Lastly there are a few structural and position based pseudo-classes that
select elements based on a number or an algebraic expression. These
pseudo-classes include `:nth-child(n)`, `:nth-last-child(n)`,
`:nth-of-type(n)`, and `:nth-last-of-type(n)`. All of these unique
pseudo-classes are prefixed with `nth` and accept a number or expression
inside of the parenthesis, indicated by the character `n` argument.

The number or expression that falls within the parenthesis determines
exactly what element, or elements, are to be selected. Using a number
outright will count individual elements from the beginning or end of the
document tree and then select one element, while using an expression
will count numerous elements from the beginning or end of the document
tree and select them in groups or multiples.

#### 6.4.3 Using Pseudo-class Numbers & Expressions

As mentioned, using numbers outright within a pseudo-class will count
from the beginning, or end, of the document tree and select one element
accordingly. For example, the `li:nth-child(4)` selector will select the
fourth list item within a list. Counting begins with the first list item
and increases by one for each list item, until finally locating and
selecting the forth item. When using a number outright it must be a
positive number.

[Expressions
for pseudo-classes](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/understandingnthchildexpressions) fall in the format of `an`, `an+b`, `an-b`, `n+b`,
`-n+b`, and `-an+b`. The same expression may be translated and read as
`(a×n)±b`. The `a` variable stands for the multiplier in which elements
will be counted in while the `b` variable stands for where the counting
will begin or take place.

For example, the `li:nth-child(3n)` selector will identify every third
list item within a list. Using the expression this equates to `3×0`,
`3×1`, `3×2`, and so forth. As you can see the results of this
expression lead to the third, sixth, and every element a multiple of
three being selected.

Additionally, the `odd` and `even` keyword values may be used. As
expected, these will select odd or even elements respectively. Should
keyword values not be appealing the expression of `2n+1` would select
all odd elements while the expression of `2n` would select all even
elements.

Using the `li:nth-child(4n+7)` selector will identify every forth list
item starting with the seventh list item. Again, using the expression
this equates to `(4×0)+7`, `(4×1)+7`, `(4×2)+7`, and so forth. The
results of this expression leading to the seventh, eleventh, fifteenth,
and every element a multiple of four here on out being selected.

Using the `n` argument without being prefixed by a number results in the
`a` variable being interpreted as `1`. With the `li:nth-child(n+5)`
selector every list item will be selected starting with the fifth list
item, leaving the first four list items unselected. Within the
expression this breaks down as `(1×0)+5`, `(1×1)+5`, `(1×2)+5`, and so
forth.

To make things a bit more complicated negative numbers may also be used.
For example, the `li:nth-child(6n-4)` selector will start counting every
sixth list item starting at negative four, selecting the second, eighth,
and fourteenth list items and so forth. The same selector,
`li:nth-child(6n-4)`, could also be written as `li:nth-child(6n+2)`,
without the use of a negative `b` variable.

A negative `a` variable, or a negative `n` argument, must be followed by
a positive `b` variable. When preceded by a negative `a` variable or
negative `n` argument the `b` variable identifies how high the counting
will reach. For example, the `li:nth-child(-3n+12)` selector will select
every third list item within the first twelve list items. The selector
`li:nth-child(-n+9)` will select the first nine list items within a list
as the `n` argument, without any stated `a` variable, is defaulted to
`-1`.

#### 6.4.4 :nth-child(n) & :nth-last-child(n)

With a general understanding of how the pseudo-class numbers and
expressions work let's take a look at the actual pseudo-classes in which
these numbers and expressions may be used, the first of which being the
`:nth-child(n)` and `:nth-last-child(n)` pseudo-classes. These
pseudo-classes work a bit like the `:first-child` and `:last-child`
pseudo-classes in that they look, and count, all of the elements within
a parent and only select the element specifically identified. The
`:nth-child(n)` works from the beginning of the document tree while the
`:nth-last-child(n)` works from the end of the document tree.

Using the `:nth-child(n)` pseudo-class, let's look at the
`li:nth-child(3n)` selector. The selector here will identify every third
list item, thus lines 4 and 7 are selected.

```
li:nth-child(3n) {...}

```

```

<ul>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
</ul>

```

Using a different expression within the `:nth-child(n)` pseudo-class
will yield a different selection. The `li:nth-child(2n+3)` selector, for
example, will identify every second list item starting with the third
and then onward. As a result, the list items lines 4 and 6 are selected.

```

li:nth-child(2n+3) {...}

```

```

<ul>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

```

Changing the expression again, this time with a negative value, yields
new selection. Here the `li:nth-child(-n+4)` selector is identifying the
top four list items, leaving the rest of the list items unselected, thus
lines 2 through 5 are selected.

```

li:nth-child(-n+4) {...}

```

```

<ul>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

```

Adding an negative integer before the `n` argument changes the selection
again. Here the `li:nth-child(-2n+5)` selector identifies every second
list item within the first five list items, thus the list items on lines
2, 4, and 6 are selected.

```

li:nth-child(-2n+5) {...}

```

```

<ul>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

```

Changing from the `:nth-child(n)` pseudo-class to the
`:nth-last-child(n)` pseudo-class switches the direction of counting,
with counting starting from the end of the document tree using the
`:nth-last-child(n)` pseudo-class. The `li:nth-last-child(3n+2)`
selector, for example, will identify every third list item starting from
the second to last item in a list, moving towards the beginning of the
list. Here the list items on lines 3 and 6 are selected.

```

li:nth-last-child(3n+2) {...}

```

```

<ul>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>This list item will be selected</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

```

#### 6.4.5 :nth-of-type(n) & :nth-last-of-type(n)

The `:nth-of-type(n)` and `:nth-last-of-type(n)` pseudo-classes are very
similar to that of the `:nth-child(n)` and `:nth-last-child(n)`
pseudo-classes, however instead of counting every element within a
parent the `:nth-of-type(n)` and `:nth-last-of-type(n)` pseudo-classes
only count elements of their own type. For example, when counting
paragraphs within an article, the `:nth-of-type(n)` and
`:nth-last-of-type(n)` pseudo-classes will skip any headings, divisions,
or miscellaneous elements that are not paragraphs, while the
`:nth-child(n)` and `:nth-last-child(n)` would count every element, no
matter it's type, only selecting the ones that match the element within
the stated selector. Additionally, all of the same expression
possibilities used within the `:nth-child(n)` and `:nth-last-child(n)`
pseudo-classes are also available within the `:nth-of-type(n)` and
`:nth-last-of-type(n)` pseudo-classes.

Using the `:nth-of-type(n)` pseudo-class within the `p:nth-of-type(3n)`
selector we are able to identify every third paragraph within a parent,
regardless of other sibling elements within the parent. Here the
paragraphs on lines 5 and 9 are selected.

```

p:nth-of-type(3n) {...}

```

```

<article>
  <h1>...</h1>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
  <h2>...</h2>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
</article>

```

As with the `:nth-child(n)` and `:nth-last-child(n)` pseudo-classes, the
primary difference between the `:nth-of-type(n)` and
`:nth-last-of-type(n)` pseudo-classes is that the `:nth-of-type(n)`
pseudo-class counts elements from the beginning of the document tree and
the `:nth-last-of-type(n)` pseudo-class counts elements from the end of
the document tree.

Using the `:nth-last-of-type(n)` pseudo-class we can write the
`p:nth-last-of-type(2n+1)` selector which identifies every second
paragraph from the end of a parent element starting with the last
paragraph. Here the paragraphs on lines 4, 7, and 9 are selected.

```

p:nth-last-of-type(2n+1) {...}

```

```

<article>
  <h1>...</h1>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <h2>...</h2>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
</article>

```

### 6.5 Target Pseudo-class

The `:target` pseudo-class is used to style elements when an element's
ID attribute value matches that of the URI fragment identifier. The
fragment identifier within a URI can be recognized by the hash
character, `#`, and what directly follows it. The URL
`http://example.com/index.html#hello` includes the fragment identifier
of `hello`. When this identifier matches the ID attribute value of an
element on the page, `<section id`"hello">= for example, that element
may be identified and stylized using the `:target` pseudo-class.
Fragment identifiers are most commonly seen when using
[on
page links](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/#hyperlinks), or linking to another part of the same page.

Looking at the code below, if a user would visit a page with the URI
fragment identifier of `#hello` the section with that same ID attribute
value would be stylized accordingly using the `:target` pseudo-class. If
the URI fragment identifier changes, and matches the ID attribute value
of another section, that new section may be stylized using the same
selector and pseudo-class from before.

```

section:target {...}

```

```

<section id="hello">...</section>

```

### 6.6 Empty Pseudo-class

The `:empty` pseudo-class allows elements that do not contain children
or text nodes to be selected. Comments, processing instructions, and
empty text nodes are not considered children and are not treated as
such.

Using the `div:empty` pseudo-class will identify divisions without any
children or text nodes. Below the divisions on lines 2 and 3 are
selected as they are completely empty. Even though the second division
contains a comment it is not considered to be a child, thus leaving the
division empty. The first division contains text, the third division
contains one blank text space, and the last division contains a `strong`
child element, thus they are all ruled out and are not selected.

```

div:empty {...}

```

```

<div>Hello</div>
<div><!-- Coming soon --></div><!-- This div will be selected -->
<div></div><!-- This div will be selected -->
<div> </div>
<div><strong></strong></div>

```

### 6.7 Negation Pseudo-class

The negation pseudo-class, `:not(x)`, is a pseudo-class that takes an
argument which is filtered out from the selection to be made. The
`p:not(.intro)` selector uses the negation pseudo-class to identify
every paragraph element without the class of `intro`. The paragraph
element is identified at the beginning of the selector followed by the
`:not(x)` pseudo-class. Inside of the parentheses falls the negation
selector, the class of `.intro` in this case.

Below both the `div:not(.awesome)` and `:not(div)` selectors use the
`:not(x)` pseudo-class. The `div:not(.awesome)` selector identifies any
division without the class of `awesome`, while the `:not(div)` selector
identifies any element that isn't a division. As a result the division
on line 1 is selected as well as the two sections on lines 3 and 4, thus
they are marked bold. The only element not selected is the division with
the class of `awesome`, as it falls outside of the two negation
pseudo-classes.

```

div:not(.awesome) {...}
:not(div) {...}

```

```

<div>This div will be selected</div>
<div class="awesome">...</div>
<section>This section will be selected</section>
<section class="awesome">This section will be selected</section>

```

## 7 Pseudo-elements

Pseudo-elements are dynamic elements that don't exist in the document
tree, and when used within selectors these
[pseudo-elements](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/17/taming-advanced-css-selectors/)
allow unique parts of the page to be stylized. One important point to
note, only one pseudo-element may be used within a selector at a given
time.

### 7.1 Textual Pseudo-elements

The first pseudo-elements ever released were the `:first-letter` and
`:first-line` textual pseudo-elements. The `:first-letter`
pseudo-element will identify the first letter of text within an element,
while the `:first-line` pseudo-element will identify the first line of
text within an element.

In the demonstration below the first letter of the paragraph with the
class of `alpha` is set in a larger font size and colored orange, as is
the first line of the paragraph with the class of `bravo`. These
selections are made by use of the `:first-letter` and `:first-line`
textual pseudo-elements respectively.

```

.alpha:first-letter,
.bravo:first-line {
  color: #ff7b29;
  font-size: 18px;
}

```

```

<p class="alpha">Lorem ipsum dolor...</p>
<p class="bravo">Integer eget enim...</p>

```

#### 7.1.1 Textual Pseudo-elements Demo

 color: #666;

}

.bravo:first-line {
 color: #ff7b29;
 font-size: 18px;
}

}

```

```
<p class="alpha">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla vestibulum dignissim leo a interdum. Duis eu orci velit.</p>
<p class="bravo">Integer eget enim pulvinar leo consectetur tincidunt ut sed erat. Etiam elit velit, molestie eu rutrum vel, vehicula feugiat augue. Vestibulum elementum dictum turpis ac blandit.</p>

```

### 7.2 Generated Content Pseudo-elements

The `:before` and `:after` generated content pseudo-elements create new
inline level pseudo-elements just inside the selected element. Most
commonly these pseudo-elements are used in conjunction with the
`content` property to add insignificant information to a page, however
that is not always the case. Additional uses of these psuedo-elements
may be to add user interface components to the page without having to
clutter the document with unsemantic elements.

The `:before` pseudo-element creates an pseudo-element before, or in
front of, the selected element, while the `:after` pseudo-element
creates an pseudo-element after, or behind, the selected element. These
pseudo-elements appear nested within the selected element, not outside
of it. Below the `:after` pseudo-element is used to display the `href`
attribute value of anchor links within parentheses after the actual
links. The information here is helpful, but not ultimately necessary
should a browser not support these pseudo-elements.

```

a:after {
  color: #9799a7;
  content: " (" attr(href) ")";
  font-size: 11px;
}

```

```

  text-decoration: none;
}

  <li><a href="http://google.com/">Search the Web</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/">Learn How to Build Websites</a></li>
</ul>

```

### 7.3 Fragment Pseudo-element

The `::selection` fragment pseudo-element identifies part of the
document that has been selected, or highlighted, by a user's actions.
The selection may then be stylized, however only using the `color`,
`background`, `background-color`, and `text-shadow` properties. It is
worth noting, the `background-image` property is ignore. While the
shorthand `background` property may be used to add a color, any images
will be ignored.

#### 7.3.1 Single Colon (:) versus Double Colons (::)

The fragment pseudo-element was added with CSS3 and in attempt to
differentiate pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements the double colons were
added to pseudo-elements. Fortunately most browsers will support both
values, single or double colons, for pseudo-elements however the
`::selection` pseudo-element must always start with double colons.

When selecting any of the text within the demonstration below the
background will appear orange and any text shadows will be removed
thanks to the `::selection` fragment pseudo-element. Also note, the
`::-moz-selection` Mozilla prefixed fragment pseudo-element has been
added to ensure the best support for all browsers.

```

::-moz-selection {
    background: #ff7b29;
}
::selection {
  background: #ff7b29;
}

```

#### 7.4.2 Selector Browser Support

While these selectors provide a variety of opportunity and the ability
to do some truly amazing things with CSS, they are at times plagued by
poor browser support. Before doing anything too critical check the
selectors you are wishing to use across your visitors most common
browsers, and then make the judgment call as to whether they are
appropriate or not.

CSS3.info provides a
[CSS3 Selectors Test](http://tools.css3.info/selectors-test/test.html)
tool which will inform you as to which selectors are supported by the
browser in use. It's also never a bad idea to check browser support
directly from the vendor.

Additionally, [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com/), a JavaScript
utility, provides great support for these selectors in Internet Explorer
6-8. More support, should it be necessary, can also be provided by
[jQuery selectors](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).

#### 7.4.3 Selector Speed & Performance

It is important to pay attention the speed and performance of selectors,
as using too many intricate selectors can slow down the rendering of a
page. Be attentive and when a selector begins to look a bit foreign
think about revisiting it, and seeing if a better solution can be found.

## 8 Introduction to the Cascade

### 8.1 Multiple Sources

The most common scenario authors will be concerned with are the style rules
which are declared by the author, but a style sheet may originate from
several different sources:

* The Author may specify style rules for a document
* The User may also specify style behaviors for viewing one or more documents -
  possibly through a special user interface or through a special external
  stylesheet.
* The browser will also have its own set of default rendering behaviors which,
  whether specified using an ACTUAL style sheet or by some other means
  accomplishes the same goal - behaving as if the browser has its own
  "default style sheet." This default style sheet is the base set of
  rendering rules - applied whether the user and author specify their own
  style sheet rules or not.

### 8.2 Multiple Methods

In addition, style sheet rules may be specified using several different methods, any of which are legal:

* External Style Sheets (using the HTML LINK element)

  ```

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Path To stylesheet.css" />

  ```
* Embedded Style Sheets (using the HTML STYLE element)

  ```

  <style type="text/css">
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
  </style>

  ```
* Imported Style Sheets (@import)

  ```

  <style type="text/css">
    @import url(Path To stylesheet.css)
  </style>

  ```
* Inline Style Rules (using the HTML STYLE attribute])

  ```

  <p style="font-size:14px;color:red;">Some text here...</p>

  ```
* Non-CSS rendering rules (eg: the HTML FONT element, that is deprecated in HTML5)

  ```

  <font size="3" color="red">This is some text!</font>
  <!-- Not Supported in HTML5. -->

  ```

When more than one style rule is specified for a single CSS selector or element,
using any of these sources or methods, and they are in direct conflict with one
another, what should happen? When all is said and done, CSS generates a single,
cohesive "virtual" style sheet using all the style rules (explicitly stated or
not) from all of these disparate sources; CSS "cascades" (combines) all of them
together. When conflicts arise between style rules, resolution is determined
using a weighted scale. Each style rule will carry a specific weight on this
scale; when two or more rules are in conflict, the rule with the highest weight
will "win" and be rendered.

|  | Lowest Importance |  | Highest Importance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership | Browser Defaults | Reader's Style Sheet | Author's Style Sheet |
| Specification Method | Linked Style Sheet | Embedded Style Sheet | Inline Styles |
| Element Selector Specificity | Contextual Selector Depth | Class | ID |

## 9 Inheritance

Some values are inherited by the children of an element in the document tree,
as described above. Each property defines whether it is inherited or not.

Suppose there is an H1 element with an emphasizing element (EM) inside:

```
<h1>The headline <em>is</em> important!</h1>

```

If no color has been assigned to the EM element, the emphasized "is" will
inherit the color of the parent element, so if H1 has the color blue, the EM
element will likewise be in blue.

When inheritance occurs, elements inherit computed values. The computed value
from the parent element becomes both the specified value and the computed
value on the child.

For example, given the following style sheet:

```
body { font-size: 10pt }
h1 { font-size: 130% }

```

```
<body>
  <h1>A <em>large</em> heading</h1>
</body>

```

the 'font-size' property for the H1 element will have the computed value
'13pt' (130% times 10pt, the parent's value). Since the computed value of
'font-size' is inherited, the EM element will have the computed value '13pt'
as well. If the user agent does not have the 13pt font available, the actual
value.

### 9.1 The `!important` value

The important keyword makes a declaration take precedence over normal
declarations—those that are not tagged with the important keyword.
So `p { color: red ! important }` takes precedence over `p { color: green }`.

The syntax for an important declaration is
`property: value ! important`

The relative importance of a rule also depends on its the source:
whether it comes from a style sheet specified by the document author, the user or the user agent (default stylesheet).

The order of declarations from least important to most important:

1. user agent declarations
2. user normal declarations
3. author normal declarations
4. author important declarations
5. user important declarations

User important declarations take precedence over everything else. This allows
users to override the page designer's presentation to meet their needs.
For example a user could override the text colours to be yellow on black in a
large font to make the text easier to read.

### 9.2 The `inherit` value

Each property may also have a cascaded value of 'inherit', which means that,
for a given element, the property takes the same specified value as the
property for the element's parent. The 'inherit' value can be used to enforce
inheritance of values, and it can also be used on properties that are not
normally inherited.

If the 'inherit' value is set on the root element, the property is assigned
its initial value.

In the example below, the 'color' and 'background' properties are set on the
body element. On all other elements, the 'color' value will be inherited and
the background will be transparent. If these rules are part of the user's
style sheet, black text on a white background will be enforced throughout the
document.

```
body {
 color: black !important;
 background: white !important;
}

* {
 color: inherit !important;
 background: transparent !important;
}

```
